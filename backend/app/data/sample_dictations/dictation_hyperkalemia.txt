changes. He is compliant with his lisinopril 20 milligrams daily, metformin 
1000 milligrams twice daily, and allopurinol 300 milligrams daily.

Past medical history: CKD stage 3B with baseline creatinine around 2.1, 
hypertension for 15 years, type 2 diabetes for 10 years, gout.

Medications: Lisinopril 20 mg daily, metformin 1000 mg BID, allopurinol 300 mg 
daily, aspirin 81 mg daily.

Physical examination:
Vital signs: Blood pressure 148 over 92, heart rate 76 and regular, 
temperature 98.4 Fahrenheit, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 97 percent 
on room air.

General: Alert, oriented, appears fatigued but in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs.
Extremities: No edema. Mild proximal muscle weakness bilateral lower extremities.

Laboratory results from ED:
Sodium 138, potassium 6.1 milliequivalents per liter, chloride 104, bicarb 20, 
BUN 52, creatinine 2.9 up from baseline of 2.1, glucose 142. 
Repeat potassium one hour later was 5.9.
Magnesium 1.8, phosphorus 4.2, calcium 9.1.
Troponin negative.

EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 74 beats per minute. PR interval normal. 
Notable for peaked T waves in leads V2 through V5, consistent with hyperkalemia. 
No ST segment changes. QRS duration 98 milliseconds.

Assessment:
1. Acute hyperkalemia with EKG changes in setting of acute on chronic kidney injury.
2. Acute kidney injury on CKD stage 3B. Creatinine 2.9 from baseline 2.1.

Plan:
1. Admit to telemetry for continuous cardiac monitoring.
2. IV calcium gluconate 1 gram for cardiac membrane stabilization.
3. Regular insulin 10 units IV with D50 for intracellular potassium shift.
4. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate 30 grams for potassium elimination.
5. IV normal saline for volume resuscitation.
6. Hold lisinopril.
