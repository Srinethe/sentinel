Subject: Hyperkalemia Management - Inpatient Admission Criteria

EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 2026

MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA FOR INPATIENT ADMISSION:

Inpatient admission for hyperkalemia management is considered medically necessary 
when ONE or MORE of the following criteria are met:

1. LABORATORY CRITERIA:
   - Serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L on repeat testing, OR
   - Serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mmol/L with rapid rise (>0.5 mmol/L in 24 hours), OR
   - Serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mmol/L with EKG changes

2. ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC CRITERIA (any of the following):
   - Peaked T waves
   - Prolonged PR interval (>200ms)
   - Widened QRS complex (>120ms)
   - Sine wave pattern
   - Any arrhythmia attributed to hyperkalemia

3. CLINICAL CRITERIA:
   - Hemodynamic instability requiring monitoring
   - Acute kidney injury with oliguria (<400mL/24hr)
   - Concurrent digitalis toxicity
   - Failure of outpatient management (documented)
   - Need for emergent dialysis
   - Symptoms: muscle weakness, paralysis, palpitations

4. COMORBIDITY CRITERIA:
   - Active cardiac disease with hyperkalemia
   - Post-cardiac surgery within 72 hours
   - Tumor lysis syndrome (confirmed or high risk)
   - Rhabdomyolysis

IMPORTANT: Clinical judgment should be applied. Patients with values slightly 
below thresholds may still qualify if there is documented clinical concern 
or trajectory suggesting imminent deterioration.

DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Serial potassium levels with timestamps
- 12-lead EKG with physician interpretation
- Clinical assessment documenting symptoms and exam findings
- Treatment plan and rationale for inpatient level of care

APPEAL PROCESS:
Peer-to-peer review available within 48 hours of initial determination.
